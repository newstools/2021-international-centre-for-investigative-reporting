The Nigerian economy had experienced a surge, as evidenced in the 5.01 per cent year-on-year growth in the GDP of the second quarter (Q2) of 2021, but the Q3 equivalent figures show a decline. On a quarter on quarter basis, the report said “real GDP grew at 11.07 per cent in Q3 2021 compared to Q2 2021, reflecting a higher economic activity than the preceding quarter.” The Statistician-General of the Federation and Head of the National Bureau of Statistics Simon Harry in his address on Thursday blamed the slow growth in Q3 on the COVID-19 pandemic. “You will recall that the contraction of quarters two and three of 2020 has resulted in positive growth as recorded consecutively for the last three-quarters of quarter four, 2020 with 0.11 per cent, quarter one, 2021 with 0.51 per cent and quarter two 2021 with 5.01 per cent,” he said. Harry expressed hopes in the recovery of the Nigerian economy, saying the current trend of improvement needs to be sustained. According to him, the “annual GDP growth of 2021 stands at -1.92 per cent.” The NBS report shows the aggregate GDP stood at N45.113 trillion in nominal terms.
