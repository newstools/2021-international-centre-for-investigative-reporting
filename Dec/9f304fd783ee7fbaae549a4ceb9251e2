IN A bid to accommodate the upsurge in passenger traffic during the Yuletide period, the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) has increased the number of daily trips on the Lagos-Ibadan train service. Lagos District Manager of the NRC Jerry Oche, in a statement, said the increase, effective from December 20, would last for three weeks. “The trains would operate from 8 a.m. from Dec 20 to 4p.m on January 9 to further decongest road traffic.” READ ALSO: NGO trains health extension workers in FCT to curb neonatal deaths Following the Train: N19.2 Billion wasted as Port-Harcourt – Enugu Train Service lie in ruins Jonathan Commissions Enugu – Port Harcourt Train Service He also urged passengers to board the trains with a maximum of 12kg luggage.  The Lagos-Ibadan train service is one of the two railway projects financed by the Chinese loan. A sum of $1.3 billion was expended on the project, which commenced full operations in June, 2021. Minister of Transportation Rotimi Amaechi had earlier said the Abuja-Kaduna train service generated at least N300 million every month. He added that the Federal Government planned to add 16 more trains to the Lagos-Ibadan rail line to increase revenue generation. “Currently, we are running Lagos-Ibadan from the money we are making from Abuja-Kaduna rail service,” he had said.
