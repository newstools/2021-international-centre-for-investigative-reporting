Between January and November, we mopped up over three million kilogrammes of illicit drugs and psychoactive substances in the country. We arrested 10,355 traffickers, with at least 1,000 in jail, while others are going through trials in court.” He cited statistics from the National Drug Use Survey (2018) which showed that 10.6 million people abused cannabis, making Nigeria the country with the highest number of people addicted to the psychotropic plant. In an interview with journalists, Shadrach, a lawyer, also said the agency would continue to work assiduously with informants and civil society organisations in the eastern part of the country to seek out and destroy hidden laboratories used in producing methamphetamine, a growing challenge for the agency. Also speaking, the FCT commander of the NDLEA Mohammed Malami Sokoto said new policies instituted by the chairman of the agency would end the menace of drug activities in the city.
